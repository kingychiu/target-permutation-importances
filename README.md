## Overview
This method aims to lower the feature attribution due to a feature's variance.
If a feature shows high importance to a model after the target vector is shuffled, it fits the noise.

Overall, this package 

1. Fit the given model class $M$ times with different model's `random_state` to get $M$ actual feature importances of feature f: $A_f = [a_{f_1},a_{f_2}...a_{f_M}]$.
2. Fit the given model class with different model's `random_state` and **shuffled targets** for $N$ times to get $N$ feature random importances: $R_f = [r_{f_1},r_{f_2}...r_{f_N}]$.
3. Compute the final importances of a feature $f$ by various methods, such as:
    - $I_f = Avg(A_f) - Avg(R_f)$
    - $I_f = Avg(A_f) / (Avg(R_f) + 1)$

We want $M \ge 1$ and $N \gg 1$. Having $M=1$ means the actual importances depends on only 1 model's `random_state` (Which is also fine).

Not to be confused with [sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance.html#sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance),
this sklearn method is about feature permutation instead of target permutation.

This method were originally proposed/implemented by:
- [[Paper] Permutation importance: a corrected feature importance measure](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/26/10/1340/193348)
- [[Kaggle Notebook] Feature Selection with Null Importances
](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ogrellier/feature-selection-with-null-importances/notebook)

## Features
1. Compute null importances with only one function call.
2. Support models with `sklearn` interface, including `xgboost`, `catboost`, `lightgbm`.
3. Support data in `pandas.DataFrame` and `numpy.ndarray`
4. Highly customizable with both the exposed `compute` and `generic_compute` functions. 
5. Proven effectiveness in Kaggle competitions and in [`Our Benchmarks Results`](https://target-permutation-importances.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmarks/).

Here are some examples of Top Kaggle solutions using this method:

## Install

```
pip install target-permutation-importances
```
or with poetry:
```
poetry add target-permutation-importances
```

Although this package is tested on models from `sklearn`, `xgboost`, `catboost`, `lightgbm`, they are not
a hard requirement for the installation, you can use this package for any model if it implements the `sklearn` interface.
For models that don't follow `sklearn` interface, you can use the exposed `generic_compute` method as discussed in the 
Advance Usage / Customization section.

Dependencies:
```
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.8"
numpy = "^1.21.0"
pandas = "^1.5.3"
tqdm = "^4.48.2"
beartype = "^0.14.1"
```
---

## Basic Usage

```python
# Import the function
import target_permutation_importances as tpi

# Prepare a dataset
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer

# Models
from catboost import CatBoostClassifier
from lightgbm import LGBMClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from xgboost import XGBClassifier

data = load_breast_cancer()

# Convert to a pandas dataframe
Xpd = pd.DataFrame(data.data, columns=data.feature_names)

# Compute permutation importances with default settings
result_df = tpi.compute(
    model_cls=RandomForestClassifier, # The constructor/class of the model.
    model_cls_params={ # The parameters to pass to the model constructor. Update this based on your needs.
        "n_jobs": -1,
    },
    model_fit_params={}, # The parameters to pass to the model fit method. Update this based on your needs.
    X=Xpd, # pd.DataFrame, np.ndarray
    y=data.target, # pd.Series, np.ndarray
    num_actual_runs=2,
    num_random_runs=10,
    # Options: {compute_permutation_importance_by_subtraction, compute_permutation_importance_by_division}
    # Or use your own function to calculate.
    permutation_importance_calculator=tpi.compute_permutation_importance_by_subtraction,
)

print(result_df[["feature", "importance"]].sort_values("importance", ascending=False).head())
```
Fork above code from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kingychiu/target-permutation-importances-basic-usage/notebook).

## Customization

**Changing model or parameters**

You can pick your own model by changing
`model_cls`, `model_cls_params` and `model_fit_params`, for example, using with `LGBMClassifier` 
with a `importance_type=gain` and `colsample_bytree=0.1`:

```python
result_df = tpi.compute(
    model_cls=LGBMClassifier, # The constructor/class of the model.
    model_cls_params={ # The parameters to pass to the model constructor. Update this based on your needs.
        "n_jobs": -1,
        "importance_type": "gain",
        "colsample_bytree": 0.1,
    },
    model_fit_params={}, # The parameters to pass to the model fit method. Update this based on your needs.
    X=Xpd, # pd.DataFrame, np.ndarray
    y=data.target, # pd.Series, np.ndarray
    num_actual_runs=2,
    num_random_runs=10,
    # Options: {compute_permutation_importance_by_subtraction, compute_permutation_importance_by_division}
    # Or use your own function to calculate.
    permutation_importance_calculator=tpi.compute_permutation_importance_by_subtraction,
)
```

**Changing null importances calculation**
You can pick your own calculation method by changing `permutation_importance_calculator`.
There are 2 provided calculations:
- `tpi.compute_permutation_importance_by_subtraction`
- `tpi.compute_permutation_importance_by_division`

You can also implement you own calculation function and pass it in. The function needs to follow 
`PermutationImportanceCalculatorType` specification, you can find it in
[API Reference](https://target-permutation-importances.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/)

**Advance Customization**

This package exposes `generic_compute` to allow advance customization.
Read [`target_permutation_importances.__init__.py`](https://github.com/kingychiu/target-permutation-importances/blob/main/target_permutation_importances/__init__.py) for details.
