## Overview
This method aims to lower the feature attribution due to a feature's variance.
If a feature shows high importance to a model after the target vector is shuffled, it fits the noise.

Overall, this package 

1. Fit the given model class $M$ times to get $M$ actual feature importances of feature f: $A_f = [a_{f_1},a_{f_2}...a_{f_M}]$.
2. Fit the given model class with shuffled targets for $N$ times to get $N$ feature random importances: $R_f = [r_{f_1},r_{f_2}...r_{f_N}]$.
3. Compute the final importances of a feature $f$ by various methods, such as:
    - $I_f = Avg(A_f) - Avg(R_f)$
    - $I_f = Avg(A_f) / (Avg(R_f) + 1)$

Not to be confused with [sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance.html#sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance),
this sklearn method is about feature permutation instead of target permutation.

This method were originally proposed/implemented by:
- [Permutation importance: a corrected feature importance measure](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/26/10/1340/193348)
- [Feature Selection with Null Importances
](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ogrellier/feature-selection-with-null-importances/notebook)


## Install

```
pip install target-permutation-importances
```
or
```
poetry add target-permutation-importances
```

## Basic Usage

```python
# Import the function
import target_permutation_importances as tpi

# Prepare a dataset
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer

# Models
from catboost import CatBoostClassifier
from lightgbm import LGBMClassifier
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from xgboost import XGBClassifier

data = load_breast_cancer()

# Convert to a pandas dataframe
Xpd = pd.DataFrame(data.data, columns=data.feature_names)

# Compute permutation importances with default settings
result_df = tpi.compute(
    model_cls=RandomForestClassifier, # The constructor/class of the model.
    model_cls_params={ # The parameters to pass to the model constructor.
        "n_estimators": 1,
    },
    model_fit_params={}, # The parameters to pass to the model fit method.
    X=Xpd, # pd.DataFrame, np.ndarray
    y=data.target, # pd.Series, np.ndarray
    num_actual_runs=2,
    num_random_runs=10,
)

print(result_df[["feature", "importance"]].sort_values("importance", ascending=False).head())
```

## Advance Usage / Customization
This package exposes `generic_compute` to allow customization.
Read [`target_permutation_importances.__init__.py`](https://github.com/kingychiu/target-permutation-importances/blob/main/target_permutation_importances/__init__.py) for details.


## Feature Selection Examples
- [Feature Selection for Binary Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kingychiu/feature-selection-for-binary-classification-task)

## Benchmarks

Benchmark has been done with some tabular datasets from the [Tabular data learning benchmark](https://github.com/LeoGrin/tabular-benchmark/tree/main). It is also
hosted on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/inria-soda/tabular-benchmark).

The following models with their default params are used in the benchmark:
- `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`
- `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor`
- `xgboost.XGBClassifier`
- `xgboost.XGBRegressor`
- `catboost.CatBoostClassifier`
- `catboost.CatBoostRegressor`
- `lightgbm.LGBMClassifier`
- `lightgbm.LGBMRegressor`

For the binary classification task, `sklearn.metrics.f1_score` is used for evaluation. For the regression task, `sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error` is used for evaluation.

The downloaded datasets are divided into 3 sections: `train`: 50%, `val`: 10%, `test`: 40%.
Feature importance is calculated from the `train` set. Feature selection is done on the `val` set. 
The final benchmark is evaluated on the `test` set. Therefore the `test` set is unseen to both the feature importance and selection process.


Raw result data are in [`benchmarks/results`](https://github.com/kingychiu/target-permutation-importances/tree/main/benchmarks).
